Hello!
In my solution I implemented all steps.
If I had more time, Iâ€™d investigate how to implement a reactive approach using best practices.


So for using this application follow these steps:

1. Open project folder and run "mvn clean compile package"
2. Go to docker folder.
3. Run docker compose using this command "docker-compose up -d"
4. Go to your folder with test data like product.csv and trade.csv files.
5. Run command "curl -F "file=@product.csv" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products" to populate Redis container.
6. After step 5 run command "curl -F "file=@trade.csv" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/trades" to process the trades.


I've tested the program using product.csv file(2,2 MB) and trade.csv file(4,2mb)
As results:
1. upload the product file - 478 ms.
2. process the trade file - 1440 ms(first try), 1001 ms(second try), 953ms(third try).


Thank you for your time!
I look forward to seeing you in a technical interview! ðŸŽ¯ðŸš€
